= Data Table = 

A Common Lisp library providing a data-table data-structure that has
rows of data and column names and types

* reading/writing values by row/column or index
* combining data-tables as overlapping square regions
* pulling sub tables from a data table
* comparing data from two data-tables
* conversion from data-tables of strings into data-tables of lisp-values,
  automatically guessing types if necessary
* converting from / two other common-lisp data-structures (lists of alists/plists)

== Goals ==
* easier interaction with databases by having a common data-structure that can be queried and inserted
* generating complex reports that contain multiple sections on a single spreadsheet of data
* make getting/setting values anywhere in the results easier
