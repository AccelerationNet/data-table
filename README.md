# Data Table

A Common Lisp library providing a data-table data-structure that has
rows of data and column names and types

 * reading/writing values by row/column or index
 * combining data-tables as overlapping square regions
 * pulling sub tables from a data table
 * comparing data from two data-tables
 * conversion from data-tables of strings into data-tables of lisp-values,
   automatically guessing types if necessary
 * converting from / two other common-lisp data-structures (lists of alists/plists)

## Goals
 * easier interaction with databases by having a common data-structure that can be queried and inserted
 * generating complex reports that contain multiple sections on a single spreadsheet of data
 * make getting/setting values anywhere in the results easier
